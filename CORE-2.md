## 1.1.0 Qualities

Qualities determine the number of dice a character rolls when making a check. The boundaries of qualities are intentionally fuzzy to encourage gaming the system through strong roleplay.

Bit of a muscle head? Gun jammed? Slam it against the wall with vigor to free it. More graceful? Use poise to manually eject the jammed round. Quick with your hands? Use moxie create an opportunity for a hipshot with your sidearm. Big brain? Use craft to ensure your gun doesn't jam in the first place.

## 1.2 Skills

Skills have a score that determines the target number to roll against when making checks. They are meant to represent your overall expertise in an area, whilst qualities colour your ability to apply that skill.

A high poise low craft chemist might be great at manufacturer, but not be able to do anything without a recipe. Whereas a high craft low poise chemist might be able to design novel formulations, but when it comes to manufacture their hands are so shaky that it's dangerous.

For skills and their descriptions see the [Skills](SKILLS.md) booklet.

## 1.3 Quirks

Quirks are specific abilities that allow a character to interact uniquely with the world or gain an advantage in certain situations, but, sometimes they instead impair a character either partially or wholly.

Examples: shooting multiple targets when you would normally only be able to shoot one, getting a bonus on craft checks with certain skills, behing better at athletics at the cost of struggling to drive, missing an eye reducing your aim accuracy.
