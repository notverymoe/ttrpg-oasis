# 1.0.0 Characters

A character is anything capable of thinking or performing actions. This incluides sentient things like animals, humans and AIs, but can also less non-sentient things such as automated turrets.

## 1.1.0 Abilities

Attributes determine the general ability of a character to do, know and resist.

### 1.1.1 Moxie

Moxie determines a character's ability to get stuff done.  

Want to waste a gonk? Moxie'll guide your hand to your sidearm and then to their heart. Craft a fine work of art to spread your message? Moxie's at the wheel when you're tagging with that spray. Bypass intrusion countermeasure programs? Moxie'll get you through that mess without raising alarm.

Now, that said, Moxie isn't just limited to physical acts. You'll find plenty of moxie in a character trying to lie, threaten, convince or seduce.


### 1.1.2 Smarts

Smarts determines a character's ability to know stuff well.

Need to know what chrome some punk is sporting? Smarts is already fangirling over the specifications. Need to figure out the fastest driving route? Smarts knows a shortcut through a pedestrian space. Want to understand the power structures keeping you down? Smarts doesn't think you'll get it, but'll tell you anyway.

Smarts isn't limited to just brainiac stuff either. Any con-artist who knows their work is going to need to know plenty about the subject they're trying to sell.

### 1.1.3 Poise

Poise determines a character's ability to resist stuff happening.

Suddenly blindsided by an autotruck? Poise will help you keep your cool and slide into a sick drift out of harm's way. Someone swinging a lead pipe at your head? Don't worry, poise keeps you standing strong as you deflect it with your chromed out arm. Trying to impress the thempress and they bring up that time you ruined their plans? Poise is going to help you smooth over that baseless accusation.
