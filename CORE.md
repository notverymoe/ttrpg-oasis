# 1.0 Characters

Characters include any living creature or automated/sentient machine (ie. turrets or AI). The
type of characters described by the following section however exclusively refer to intelligent
humanoids/AIs. Animals, turrets and non-humanoid mutants/aliens will likely deviate or simplify.


## 1.1 Attributes

- **(Exe)cution** Carry out physical action based on knowledge and experience.
- **(Ing)enuity** Adapt knowledge and experiences to rapidly changing or different situations.
- **(Dis)cipline** Accurately recall knowledge or experiences and resist mental and physical assault.


Attributes are scored 1-8. This number determines the base number of 12-sided dice you'll roll
when making checks. A character with an attribute score of 0 is rendered effectively helpless,
and even though they may remain conscious they are unable to control their movements or speech
and will not remember anything whilst being in this state Having your attributes reduced is 
extremely rare, typically being the domain of disease and poison.


## 1.2 Skills

Skills are scored 0-8. When making checks, this number is used to determine which dice to
keep and count as successes by checking if they rolled under or equal to the value.


A score of 0 means that you're "untrained" in that skill, which doesn't prevent you from
making checks in that skill entirely - as you can temporarily boost your skill by "brain 
racking". The GM may also decide that certain checks are impossible untrained, or require 
additional checks to make the actual check, for example to figure out how to start the 
machine - though if doing the latter you should be awarded a bonus to the untrained check 
if you succeed.


### 1.2.1 Experiences

During character creation skills are awarded through "experiences" which describe the context
of the skill they've learnt. This is intended to give something to drive roleplay off of when
using these skills, for example learning Coercion initially as a police officers and then later
improving upon it as a crook might colour your expression of it by making you more likely to
approach it from the angle of using half-truths to cause a person to sweat instead of just
yelling threats at them.

This is not prescriptive for characters however, and shouldn't be an excuse for anyone to
attempt to limit a character's abilities to certain situations - unless the Player & GM both
agree to it.


## 1.3 Talents

Talents represent useful or unique abilities that a character possesses. These can range
from simple bonuses to role in certain situations to complex actions that aren't readily
available to other characters. Some initial talents might be acquired during character
creation, however, most are expected to be earnt through play.


## 1.4 Quirks

Quicks are the drawbacks of a particular character, which range from troublesome personality
traits to illness and disabilities. Individual quirks tend to have less effect than any talent,
with a few exceptions for the more major quirks - however those then tend to either carry and
upside or are possible to be worked around. 

For example, you might be missing an eye, this negatively affects your depth perception and 
aim with a gun but you can overcome it by getting a cybernetic or synthetic eye. Another example,
might be that your character has suppressed emotions, providing a negative modifier in regular
social encounters but allows you to ignore penalties applied in situations of great fear or 
stress.

These quirks are mostly earnt during character creation and will be few in number, but can also
be earnt from play from exceptional circumstances or failing to get blackout treated.


## 1.5 Trauma (Tra)

Characters have individual physical and mental scores that track the amount of "trauma" they've
received. For physical trauma this includes things such as taking weapon fire, falling from a
height or pushing their body beyond its safe limits. For mental trauma this includes things such
as seeing or performing horrific acts (killing, coming across decomposing corpses or unknowable
forces); or putting themselves under extreme mental stress by not sleeping or being hunted. When
either trauma score reaches four plus their discipline score, the score is reset to 0 and the
character's "blackout" score increases. Excess trauma carries over on this reset, meaning that
you might get multiple increases of blackout from a single attack.

Trauma can be recovered through receiving first aid and resting.


## 1.6 Blackout (Bla)

Blackout is a score that represents trauma so great that a character may cease functioning,
falling unconscious and potentially dying. Whenever it is increased, a check is required for
every point it's increased by to determine if a character is able to remain conscious in spite
of this sudden and severe trauma. 


To make this check, simply roll a check using discipline with blackout as the skill, using only
modifiers that explicitly affect blackout rolls. A "successful" check here means that the 
character falls unconscious. The required degree for a "success" is equal to the character's 
discipline minus two. An unconscious character is not at immediate risk of death and will awake
on their own after ten times the blackout score times 1d12 minutes, but can be awoken earlier 
with by making a opposed check vs the character's blackout with an appropriate skill. 


If a blacked out character increases their blackout, they mark themselves as at risk of death
and make rolls as normal. A character at risk of dying cannot be roused prematurely by others,
they increase their blackout score by one every half-hour, and will die if they make another 
successful blackout check. If the character awakens or is stabilized, they are no longer at 
risk of death.


Characters apply their blackout score as a negative modifier on checks, limited to one minus
the attribute being rolled. For example, a check with 4 Exe and 8 Blk will only apply a 
modifier of -3, bringing it to effectively a 1 Exe. Other modifiers don't adjust this limit,
so having negative circumstances can still bring your pool to or bellow zero.

# 2.0 Making Checks

Checks are typically called for when the GM believes an action has a chance or failure or a
variable outcome. 


## 2.1 Determine Attribute & Skill

A GM should almost always call for a certain attribute, but the player is free to suggest a 
skill they can use - even if the GM calls for a specific one. If the player does suggest a 
skill, the GM has final say on if it's applicable. 


For example:

> **PC:** I'd like to open this door  
> **GM:** Make me a Execution check, it appears to be locked  
> **PC:** Would hacking do it?  
> **GM:** That'd work, there's an interface panel to the side.  
> **PC rolls using Execution with their Hacking skill**


Or, alternatively:

> **PC:** I'd like to try to disable this bomb.  
> **GM:** Okay, make a Execution Explosives check.  
> **PC:** Could I use Electronics instead?  
> **GM:** Unfortunately this explosive is entirely chemical-based, you could make a harder chemistry check?  
> **PC:** Alright, I've actually got that one, so I'll give it a go!  
> **PC rolls using Execution with their Chemistry skill**


## 2.2 Modifiers

Once the attribute and skill are set, you also need to determine any modifiers.
Typically players should track any modifiers that are related to their character
and their positioning, and the GM can provide information about what abilities/
experiences apply on request and inform the player of environmental modifiers.

The modifiers will greatly affect a character's chances at success, so it's 
extremely important to get them nailed down. These are all added together and
limited to the range -6 to +6, inclusive.


## 2.3 Rolling

The attribute being used for the roll determines the base number of 12-sided dice to 
roll. You then apply the modifier to the number of dice, adding or removing based on
if the modifier is positive or negative respective. If you would roll no dice, you fail 
automatically - unless you "push luck".


Roll the dice once you resolve the size of the pool. Compare each of the dice to the skill
being used and discard any that are greater than your skill. The number of dice remaining
is called the success "degree" (ie. 2 dice remaining, success in the 2nd degree ), the 
highest value of the remaining dice is called the "ceiling" of the roll, and the lowest
remaining the "floor" of the roll.


The degree is used to determine success. Very generally, 1 success for an (E)asy task,
2 successes for an (M)oderate task; 3-4 for a (H)ard task; 5-6 for a (P)unishing task; 
7-9 for a (L)egendary task; 10-11 for an (U)nbelievable task and 12+ for a (D)ivine 
task. Generally most humans will be able to complete hard tasks given enough time, but
most would fail to complete a punishing task without aid or pushing their luck.


The ceiling is typically used to determine secondary positive effects, whilst the floor
is typically used to determine the potential severity of a failed check or tertiary 
effects (being a 0 on a success in the 0th degree).


### 2.3.1 Rack Brain

Before rolling, a character may choose to "rack" their brain, taking a -2 penalty to
their dice pool size in exchange for a +1 modifier to their skill. Racking your brain is
the one of the only way to perform skills untrained, it's not ideal but it might save
your bacon.


You can only rack your brain once per check, if you fail the check the GM is encouraged
to use your roll's floor to determine a suitable set back.


### 2.3.2 Push Luck

Before rolling, a character may choose to "push" their luck, taking a -2 penalty to 
their skill in exchange for a +1 modifier to their dice pool for the check. This modifier
is applied separately from regular modifiers, treating negatively-sized dice pools as
being zero-sized. For example, a dice pool reduced to -2 and then pushed would result
in a pool size of 1 and not -1.


You can only push your luck once per check, if you fail the check the GM is encouraged
to use your roll's floor to determine a suitable set back.


## 2.4 Opposed Checks

When two or more characters are taking mutually exclusive actions, they make their checks
at the same time. The character with the higher success beats the other. On a tie they 
compare and discard their highest value die, the winner being the one with the highest 
value die. This repeats until a winner is determined, or all dice are lost. If all dice
are lost, both fail/tie the check and the GM determines what occurs (ie. reroll, setback).


Beating a character in an opposed check doesn't mean that the you succeed the action, this
is evaluated separately from the opposed check and may result in a lower success due to the
discarding of additional dice. This is to simulate the characters interfering with each other's
attempts or otherwise being stressed/distracted by them.


## 2.5 Group Checks

Group checks are simply made by having each individual player make a regular check and adding
the successes together. The required successes may also be adjusted to prevent group checks
moving into the realm of impossibility. In most cases group checks are only appropriate when 
making singular coordinated efforts.

Exceptions exist for certain opposed checks. A prime example would be a group of sneaking 
characters making an opposed check against a single spotter. The character's sneaking ability
here isn't cumulative, but they can make up for the blunders of others. In this case, the total
number of successes are divided by the number of characters in the group and a pool is pieced
together from each character's rolls, going around and taking a single die at a time from each 
character's  check until they reach the averaged degree of success, using for the opposed check.
This is referred to as a "group average check".


## 2.6 Aiding

Any character may attempt to aid another character. To do so, make a check with a skill and 
attribute that could assist theirs. If you're successful, as determined by the GM, then the
character is aided and gains a +1 modifier. A character cannot be aided by multiple times,
except in exceptional circumstances as determined bt the GM.


## 2.7 Skill-less Checks

Skill-less checks exist for cases where there's not relevant skill for the check. For example,
trying to violently shake someone awake, hope that they had the discipline to prepare some spare
weapons in the cargo crawlspace, or . This can be considered a type of "luck" roll that's
affected subtly by the character's base attributes.

# Misc Notes

- Numbers are always rounded toward 0 when doing math stuff.

- A character's death is not the end. Technology exists to back up minds, grow new bodies
  or put the body into stasis to allow transport of it to a intensive care unit before they
  become unrecoverable. These options are all very expensive however, and time-sensitive.

- Weapons deal fixed damages based on the ceiling of the check, to a location determined
  by the floor.

- Automatic weapons may apply a modifier to the hit of a weapon and allow certain tactical
  types of firing, at the cost of dealing lower higher end damage and having a lower chance
  of dealing damage to critical body parts - it's assumed that aiming it impossible.

- Burst weapons may apply a modifier to the hit of a weapon and deal more high-end damage, but 
  chew through ammunition and don't provide additional tactical options over a single-bullet 
  semi-auto.

- Cone weapons (shotguns) automatically hit within a certain distance, but have quickly loose
  effectiveness at far ranges and are slow to reload.

- Explosive are dangerous. You'll blow your self up eventually.


# Design notes

- Melee weapons need to be made viable somehow. Not extremely viable, but enough that a switchblade
  or club is an option. Potentially by allowing them to use their weapon to interfere with the aim
  of their opponent.
  
- Character creation will be done via "lifepath"-style creation. Basically a choose your own adventure, where roles determine some of the outcomes (if you do well in a career, life complications etc.)
